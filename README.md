GATE Preparation Dashboard

A personal web-based dashboard designed to organize and track GATE (ECE) exam preparation.

This project focuses on clarity, responsiveness, and practicality rather than flashy frameworks.

Built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
________________________________________
🚀 Overview
Preparing for GATE involves juggling syllabus topics, previous year questions, lectures, revisions, and daily tasks.

This dashboard brings all of that into one place with a clean, distraction-free interface.

The project is intentionally framework-free to strengthen core front-end fundamentals and ensure full control over layout and behavior.
